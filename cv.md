#### Code example:

**7 kyu Fix My Phone Numbers! from Codewars:** Given a string, you must decide whether or not it contains a valid phone number. If it does, return the corrected phone number as a string ie. `'02078834982'` with no whitespace or special characters, else return `"Not a phone number"`.

```
function isItANum(str) {
  let array = str.split("");
let number = array.filter(item => item === "0" || item === "1" || item === "2" || item === "3" || item === "4"|| item === "5" || item === "6" || item === "7" || item === "8" || item === "9");;
let numberString = number.join("");
  if ( numberString.length === 11 && numberString[0] == 0) {
  return numberString;
} else {
  return "Not a phone number";
}
